        <p class="lead mb-4">When I was in High School, I was not allowed to have a job. I focused on my studies, so that I may have a better chance at getting into the school of my choosing. Instead of working, I decided to partake in multiple extracurricular activities. For example, I was on the Varsity Dance Team for two years, in which I learned many valuable skills on how to be a proper leader. I would lead stretches, make sure everyone was focused, and even help choreograph dances along with my team members.When I was a sophomore, I started my own club for girls who wanted to be businesswomen. We went over the history of strong, successful businesswomen, created our own business plans,etc. This experience allowed me to expand my knowledge in business, as well as connect with other like minded women.I was also the ASB (Associated Student Body) dance commisioner my senior year, where I was in charge of planning all of the school dances. This taught me valuable lessons about being organized and making sure I am efficiently using all of the time in my day.<br><br>

        My senior year of high school, after i had turned 18, I was allowed to get my first job. I started off at Thai Smile, which is a Thai restaurant near my house. I was a hostess, and it was my first time ever working at a job. I was only there for a week, however, as a better opportunity presented itself at another restaurant. While I was not there for long, I learned many valuable things that would help me at all jobs in the future. At Thai Smile, I was responsible for answering the phone, taking togo orders and packing them, ringing out customers at the cash register, and seating people in a rotating section matter. I learned that it is crucial to use your time extremely efficiently, as hungry people do not make for very happy people. You have to be able to serve people in a timely manner to satisfy their needs, without overwhelming the servers and the rest of the staff. <br><br>

        My next job was at The Palms Cafe. There, I was also a hostess. My main responsibilities remained the same, except I added a few more on. I had to seat people at their table, answer the phone, take togo orders, run cards for the servers, take drinks to tables, fold children's menus, buss tables, and generally help out wherever I could. This job taught me how to multitask, and how to keep a smile no matter what. It was very important that I kept the customers happy at this job, as most of them were elderly and short tempered. I have had to deal with many different types of customers at this job and it has taught me to have much more patience when it comes to talking to customers. This job was not always easy, but it was always teaching me new lessons. I have been in many unexpected situations where I did not know what to do, and had to figure out how to compromise and come to a solution with whomever I was speaking to. Many times, customers wanted to speak to my manager, claiming that I had done something wrong, when they were mad about something I could not control, and I had to learn how to keep my temper. Overall, this job has taught me many valuable lessons, and I am glad that I had the opportunity to experience them.
